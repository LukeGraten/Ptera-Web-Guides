## NINTENDO SWITCH SETUP

This section is for you Nintendo Switch players. We are using a tool developed by our server maintainer to add you on our server. It's simpler than you think and takes only minutes to set up.

### BUYING AND INSTALLING MINECRAFT (NINTENDO SWITCH)

In order to join our server on Nintendo Switch, you need to have a copy of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on your console. 
You also need to have an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription for multiplayer. You also need a Microsoft account.
If you already have these, feel free to skip to the next section.

1a) Open the Nintendo eShop on your Switch and search up Minecraft or log into the [Nintendo Store](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/minecraft-switch/).

1b) Click on `Purchase` or `Direct Download` to buy Minecraft for $30 USD. Wait for it to install onto your Switch. 

1c) After Minecraft has installed make sure you have an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription, by checking in the app on the home menu.
If you don't have an active subscription, buy it off the eShop or [here](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/online/).

1d) Sign into your Microsoft account in the title screen. If you don't have a Microsoft account, create one [here](https://account.microsoft.com/account/).

### JOINING THE SERVER (NINTENDO SWITCH)

2a) Go into the settings app. Go into the internet settings of your network and change the default primary DNS address to `163.74.82.172`. For the secondary one, input `8.8.8.8`. Thanks to our developer and maintainer, he set up a customized DNS server for us to connect your Switch console to the server. 

2b) Once the new DNS address has been put in, save your internet settings. Then open up Minecraft and go into the server menu. You should see 2 of the featured servers have a message indicating Ptera‚Äôs server below their names.

2c) Fill out this Google [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeEBVKIESOidbwOyYXCdaG4JxFVVfZEXefyW7vQQQHF83sEYQ/viewform?usp=send_form) if you haven't and DM Ptera or a moderator about you filling it out to ensure you get added.

2d) Clicking on either one of them will log you into our server instantly. 

‚ö†Ô∏è If you get an error saying you aren't on the whitelist, DM a moderator and they will get things sorted out. Try to rejoin after that.

### ‚úÖ You have everything needed to join our server. We highly recommend installing some mods to improve Minecraft's performance. You can end here, but follow sections 4+ to install mods if you'd like.
