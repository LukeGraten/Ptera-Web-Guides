# Ptera Web Guides README

This github was made by me (Magic) so the guides can all be centralized. You are getting the latest versions
of these guides, freshly right off the trunk. 
Feel free to propose any changes to the guides if you like by committing! Anyone can! â™¥

The `Contributor` branch is for people to propose changes to.

The `Final Version` branch reflects the main version of the guides, presented to people.
If you want to just read the guides for help, use this branch.
