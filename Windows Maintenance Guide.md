## UPDATING MINECRAFT

### UPDATING MINECRAFT (JAVA EDITION)

Our server usually does a good job keeping up to date. 
But you also need to update too. Here's how to update the base Minecraft game

1a) Open the Minecraft Launcher. The launcher auto-checks for updates.
You might see it download a new version of itself. If it doesn't update itself
you are likely up to date with the launcher.

1b) Select the `Latest Version` in the drop-down menu left of the play button.

1c) The game will download the latest game files to your PC.

1d) Minecraft will launch! You are now up to date.

‚ö†Ô∏è For those who have the base game only or have only
followed sections 1-3 in the quickstart guide, you are done here.

### UPDATING MINECRAFT (BEDROCK EDITION)

Bedrock Players have a similar process. But this involves the Microsoft store.

1a) Open the Microsoft Store app on your PC. Navigate to library, and 
click `Check for Updates`. Minecraft Bedrock (and other apps) will download 
updates. If an update doesn't download, you are up to date with the game.

1b) Open the Minecraft Launcher. The launcher auto-checks for updates.
You might see it download a new version of itself. If it doesn't update itself
you are likely up to date with the launcher.

1c) Launch Minecraft Bedrock and you are done! Be sure to do this every so often.
