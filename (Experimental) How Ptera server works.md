## Minecraft Version
Our server is always based off the latest version of Minecraft.
Right now it's currently `1.19.3`. Historically it takes around 2
weeks to for everything to be updated.

## Server "Base"

The server is currently using Fabric as the "base" of it.
 This is different than Paper or Spigot. As we use mods instead of plugins.

## Mods We Use

**Lithium**

Lithium is a modern, general-purpose optimization mod 
for Minecraft which works to improve a 
number of systems (game physics, mob AI, block ticking, etc) 
with the goal of not changing any vanilla mechanics.

**Geyser**

Geyser is a middleware, 
which translates all the incoming and
outgoing packets (pieces of data your client and server
send between each other to maintain good networking).
