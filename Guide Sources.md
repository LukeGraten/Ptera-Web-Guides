### WHY WE USE MODRINTH

We use Modrinth over Curseforge as our mod website, because we believe it will give a more user friendly experience. Downloads are typically quicker using this site compared to Curseforge. We only use Curseforge links if the mod we are listing doesn't have a Modrinth web page.
