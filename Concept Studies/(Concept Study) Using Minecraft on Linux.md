I'm switching to Linux soon! I've been meaning to do 
this for quite a while. I feel that Linux software applications
have gotten good enough for daily driving. Many of my applications
have Linux versions and most of my games has a Gold or higher rating on
ProtonDB.

* **Current OS:** Windows 11 22H2
* **Planned Distribution (Distro):** Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS

## My System Hardware

* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5900HX
* **iGPU:** Radeon Vega iGPU
* **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 3060 Laptop GPU (115-130W)
* **RAM:** 16GB DDR4 
* **STORAGE:** 1TB SSD 
* **DISPLAY:** 1080p 144HZ 16:9 Aspect Ratio
* **OEM/MODEL:** ASUS ROG STRIX G15 Laptop (2021)

## JOURNEY NOTES

To start I bought a fresh 64GB USB Drive from SanDisk
You can get the one I got [here](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sandisk-ultra-64gb-usb-3-0-flash-drive-black/9211078.p?skuId=9211078)

I then backed up my data, most of which is in the cloud already.
The only things I really needed to back up was for my emulators.

I then got saved my Windows 11 product key for later. In case I really needed to switch back


Next order was to flash Pop!_OS onto the USB. I followed their own [web guide](https://support.system76.com/articles/live-disk/) to do that. 

[BelenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher) was extremely easy to use.

Next is to clean out the Laptop. I'm planning to get a pro to dust it since I'm lazy.
