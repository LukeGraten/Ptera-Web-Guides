Title: Paper Study
Description: To see the alternatives and study PaperMC more.

PaperMC, which is typically better for servers, 
could be used to replace Fabric as the base for our server. 
I'm exploring whether if this is viable and possible.
Due to the fact that most of our mods 
have Paper plugin versions. I'm currently studying about 
this, to see if it would hypothetically work.

A little over half of all our mods have a direct
plugin version compatible with Paper.

## How to Switch From Fabric to Paper (WIP)

Paper does not support Fabric or Forge mods. 
You will need to find plugin replacements. 
Any hybrids that 
attempt to support both mods and plugins are 
fundamentally flawed and not recommended for use.

⚠️ When migrating to Paper from Fabric, the way 
worlds are stored will automatically be changed.

2a) `Stop` your Fabric server 
if it is running, and create a `full backup`.

**CREATE A BACKUP!!!**

2b) Download Paper from the downloads page and 
replace your Fabric server jar with 
your freshly downloaded Paper jar.

2c) Download the Terralith Datapack and
install it into the server Datapack folder.

2d) Run the Paper Server to see if everything works.

2e)
