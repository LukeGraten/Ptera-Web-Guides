## BUYING & INSTALLING MINECRAFT

If you don't have Minecraft at all, you need to install it. Before, you had to choose between Java (Recommended) and Bedrock Edition. Thankfully you can buy both versions for $30 USD. But we still recommend using the Java Edition when logging into the server, as it's natively supported.

🔴 To buy Minecraft for Windows 10 click this link.

🔴 Register your payment information (credit card). Once filled out, and bought, click 'Download for Windows'. The Minecraft Launcher will download onto your Windows PC.

🔴 Sign into the launcher with your Microsoft account. Make sure the version drop-down to the left is selected to 'Latest Version'. 

🔴 Click 'Play', the launcher will download the game files to your device and launch into the title screen. Once launched into the title screen, close the game by pressing 'Quit'. 

## 🧠ALLOCATING RAM

This section will be referenced multiple times. If you are seeing this section for the first time, we will be increasing the amount of RAM or memory to increase Minecraft's performance.  

🔴 In the main page of the launcher, click the 'Installations' tab at the top. While here make sure 'Modded' and 'Snapshots' are checkmarked if they aren't.

🔴 Click on the version you want to allocate RAM to. If this is the first time, select the 3 little vertical dots on the 'Latest Release' version and click 'Edit'.

🔴 In the installation editor, click 'More Options'. In the 'JVM Arguments' box, you will see a -Xmx2G -XX followed by a chain of text. 

⚠️ Make sure you know how much RAM you have on your PC! You can look it up in the Windows Settings by typing 'About PC' and looking it up.

 Allocating more than half of it is generally a bad idea. So for example if you have a PC with 8GB, allocate up to 4GB. If you have a higher RAM count, such as 16GB or 32GB, allocating more than 8GB to Minecraft usually yields diminishing returns.

🔴 Once comfortable with allocating the amount of RAM you want, change the number between the x and the G to it. Click 'Save' and Go to the 'Play' tab. 

## 👋JOINING THE SERVER

Time to join the server! This is pretty easy and seamless

🔴 Launch Minecraft and go to the 'Multiplayer' Tab in the title screen.

🔴 Click 'Add Server' and in the 'Server Name' field, type in 'Ptera's Forest'. 

🔴 In the 'Server Address' field, type in the IP address of our server. play.ptera.tv

🔴 Click done and the server should be saved to your server list. Fill out this Google form and DM Ptera or a moderator about you filling it out to ensure you get added.

🔴 Once you are added to the server join it in the server list by hovering over the server picture and clicking the gray 'Play Button'. You should be able to join and will be at spawn. 

⚠️ If you get an error saying you aren't on the whitelist, DM a moderator and they will get things sorted out. Try to rejoin after that.

🟩 You have everything needed to join our server. We highly recommend installing some mods to improve Minecraft's performance.

## ☕(OPTIONAL) DOWNLOAD JAVA JDK

Minecraft comes with its own standalone version of Java pre-installed. But I recommend installing it anyway as it doesn't hurt and some mod loaders need Java installed. Installing Java takes little time to do.

🔴To begin the installation process, go to the Java download page by clicking this link. This will take you to Oracle's website, where you can download Java from the official source. Oracle is the company that develops and maintains Java.

🔴To download the latest version of Java, go to the Java download page and look for the section labeled 'Java SE 17.0.6'. Click the link labeled 'Windows x64 Installer' to download the appropriate version for your PC.

🔴To install Java, simply follow the instructions in the installer by clicking "Next" a few times. Java will then install. Once the installation is complete, you can close the installer. Java is ready.

## 🧶INSTALLING FABRIC

Fabric is lightweight and is blossoming with new mods everyday. Most of us here actually use Fabric as our primary loader. Before you install Fabric, make sure to close the Minecraft Launcher. Fabric won't install if it's still open.

You can download Fabric here

🔴On the Fabric download page, you'll see two options: 'Download for Windows' or ' Download Universal Jar'. Click 'Download For Windows'.

⚠️ The Windows download doesn't need Java to be installed on your system as it uses the version the launcher has. If you are experiencing issues with the Windows installer, choose the 'Download Universal Jar' option and install Java if you haven't.

🔴To install Fabric, double click the installer file in your downloads folder. The Fabric installer will open and display the latest version of the loader (0.14.14) and Minecraft (1.19.3) by default. Make sure the option on the top left is set to 'Client', then click the 'Install' button to begin the process.

🔴After you click 'Install', Fabric will begin the installation process and create a profile in the Minecraft launcher. This will allow you to easily access and launch the Fabric version of Minecraft from within the launcher.

🔴 Go back to the allocating RAM section and allocate RAM for the Fabric install instead of the Latest Version install. 

🔴 After allocating RAM, launch Fabric and go if you are in the title screen, Fabric is now installed correctly.
