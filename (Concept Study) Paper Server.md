**ℹ️Server Rebase Information**
---------------------------------------
PaperMC, which is typically better for servers, could be used to replace Fabric as the base for our server. I'm exploring if this is viable.
Due to the fact that most of our mods have Paper plugin versions. I'm currently studying about this, to see if it would hypothetically work.
