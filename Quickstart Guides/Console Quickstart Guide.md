## USING BEDROCKCONNECT

If you want to use a more versatile tool of connecting to Java servers or don't want to use our in-house DNS server then use BedrockConnect! Setting up BedrockConnect
is strikingly similar to using our DNS tool. Lets get into it! BedrockConnect can be used on any console.

1a) Follow your respective console section until you get up to step 2a, the DNS switching section.

| IP Address | Location | Maintainer | Note |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 104.238.130.180 | <img src="https://flagicons.lipis.dev/flags/4x3/us.svg" height="20"> | [Pugmatt](https://github.com/Pugmatt) | Main instance. Multiple load balanced servers. Might be blocked on PS4, try another instance if you experience issues. |
| 173.82.100.84 | <img src="https://flagicons.lipis.dev/flags/4x3/us.svg" height="20"> | [jdextraze](https://github.com/jdextraze) | |
| 213.171.211.142 | <img src="https://flagicons.lipis.dev/flags/4x3/gb.svg" height="20"> | [kmpoppe](https://github.com/kmpoppe) | No DNS service, only BedrockConnect server  |
| 217.160.58.93 | <img src="https://flagicons.lipis.dev/flags/4x3/de.svg" height="20"> | [kmpoppe](https://github.com/kmpoppe) | No DNS service, only BedrockConnect server |
| 188.165.49.178 | <img src="https://flagicons.lipis.dev/flags/4x3/fr.svg" height="20"> | [Darkmoi3108](https://github.com/darkmoi3108) | |
| 134.255.231.119 | <img src="https://flagicons.lipis.dev/flags/4x3/de.svg" height="20"> | [ZAP-Hosting](https://github.com/zaphosting) | |
| 91.218.66.13 | <img src="https://flagicons.lipis.dev/flags/4x3/de.svg" height="20"> | [LazyBirb](https://github.com/LazyBirb) | |

1b) Choose the DNS server in the chart closest to your real world location for the best connection.

1c) Open Minecraft and go to the featured servers tab.

1d) Click `Connect to a Server` and input our IP address `play.ptera.tv`. The port does not need to be changed.

1e) Toggle `Add to server list` and the server should be readily available on the featured server list. 

1f) Fill out this Google [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeEBVKIESOidbwOyYXCdaG4JxFVVfZEXefyW7vQQQHF83sEYQ/viewform?usp=send_form) if you haven't, and DM Ptera or a moderator about you filling it out to ensure you get added.
